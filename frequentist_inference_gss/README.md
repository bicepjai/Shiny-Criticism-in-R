# Frequentist Inference

Frequentist Inference methods such as Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are performed on "The General Social Survey​" data collected from 1972. This data has provided politicians, policymakers, and scholars with a clear and unbiased perspective on what Americans think and feel about such issues as national spend​ing priorities, crime and punishment, intergroup relations, and confidence in institutions.

This projects answers the following research questions

1. Hypothesis test on two means:
   In the GSS survey, population sample incomes were collected. Determine if there is a difference in mean income between the people affiliated with Democrats and people affiliated with Republicans from year 2006 to 2012

2. Hypothesis test on many groups:
   In the GSS survey, population sample incomes were collected. Determine if there is a difference between the mean income collected from all different party affiliations (democrat, independent, republican and other) in 2010.

3. Hypothesis test on two proportions:
   In the GSS survey, a sample of population were asked whether they think United States is spending too much money on it, too little money, or about the right amount in improving the conditions of Blacks. Determine if there is a difference in the proportion of the people who said “too little money” in the years 2008 and 2010.

4. Chi-square test for goodness to fit:
   In the GSS survey, determine if the distribution of people following different religion in 2008 is similar to the distribution among the people sample in 2010.

5. Chi-square test for independence:
   In the GSS survey, one of the variable was answers to the question about whether abortion can be an option for any woman who wants it, another variable is about how confident one is when it comes to the scientific community. Determine if these variables are independent.
