# Shiny-Criticism-in-R

The project is a collection of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and Frequentist and Bayesian Inferences performed on random datasets in R, and published using RStudioâ€™s package, RPubs and Shiny. Analysis is performed on datasets from published studies and other free data resources available on-line. The study conducted cannot be attributed to any causal relation ship since its only an observational study and not a controlled experiment.
